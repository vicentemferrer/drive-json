# JSON for Google Drive

## Overview
Embed your static files from your Google Drive storage.

It eases a way to use Google Drive storage as a static files server like images (overall created to provide images). 
It caught files info and add them an url to embed in your web pages to finally dump the data collection into a JSON 
file which you can use to include your images using Google Drive as an external provider.
